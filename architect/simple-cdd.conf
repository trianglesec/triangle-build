# Profile Selection
#
# The following four files get included on the CD if present:
# $profile.preseed
#   Debconf selections.
# $profile.packages
#   Packages to be installed with the profile. Dependencies also will
#   be installed.
# $profile.downloads
#   Additional packages to be included on the CD with this profile, but
#   not installed by default.
# $profile.postinst
#   Post-install script that is run after installing packages.
#
# During the install after base system setup, it will give you the
# options to determine which profiles you want to install.

# Profiles to include on the CD
#profiles=""
#profiles="x-basic ltsp"

# To automatically select profiles (must also be listed in profiles):
